A comprehensive MySQL database for managing a library's operations, including books, members, loans, and more.

## Description

This Library Management System database provides a complete solution for managing all aspects of a library's operations. It includes functionality for:

- Managing reservations for books
- Tracking fines for late returns, damaged books, or lost items

The database is designed with proper relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many) and includes constraints to maintain data integrity. It also includes views for common queries and stored procedures for common operations.
