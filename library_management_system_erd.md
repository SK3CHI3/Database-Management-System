# Library Management System ERD

This is a placeholder for the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the Library Management System database.

To create a proper ERD:
1. Import the SQL file into a database design tool like MySQL Workbench, dbdiagram.io, or draw.io
2. Generate the ERD from the database schema
3. Export the ERD as an image file named `library_management_system_erd.png`
4. Replace this file with the image

## Text-Based ERD Reference

For a text-based representation of the ERD, please refer to the `library_management_system_erd.txt` file in this repository.
